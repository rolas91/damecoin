Notwithstanding the above, you hereby understand and agree that the Price displayed on the Site for Purchase or Sale of the Digital Currency is accurate for the thirty (30) minutes immediately following the initial step in the placement of an order (the “Preliminary Price”), and the Preliminary Price which appears on the Site upon your order may not be the final price or rate of your transaction. This is due to the highly volatile nature of the price of Digital Currency and the period of time that may be required for completing the transaction, as further detailed below.</p>

<p>4.2.3. The final price of your transaction (the “<strong>Final</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Price</strong>”) will be the price which appears on the Site upon:</p>

<ol style="color: #20509e !important;">
	<li>the processing of a credit/debit card Fiat Money payment in a Purchase order, provided that you successfully submit the payment within the thirty (30) minutes immediately following the initial step in your placement of this order (after which, the order permanently expires and cannot be fulfilled);</li>
	<li>our receipt of confirmation of payment from our bank, with respect to a Fiat Money payment made by you via bank wire transfer in a Purchase order; and</li>
	<li>the actual crediting of a Company Wallet Address designated by us for your Sale order, with respect to the Digital Currency credited by you to us in that Sale, provided that the crediting was completed within the thirty (30) minutes immediately following the initial step in your placement of this order (after which, the order permanently expires and cannot be fulfilled).</li>
</ol>

<p>4.2.4. You understand and agree that the Final Price may be either higher or lower than any other rate or price which was previously available on the Site, in accordance with value fluctuation which may occur, and that this may change either in your favor or in the Company’s and we have no control whatsoever on such change. A Price in Fiat Money for a transaction is locked for thirty (30) minutes when the initial step in the placement of the Purchase/Sale order is logged (the Preliminary Price); once the Preliminary Price has expired, the Final Price will apply to any applicable transaction.</p>

<p>4.2.5. As soon as reasonably practicable thereafter, and subject to the completion of our KYC process and/or other inspections to our satisfaction, we shall execute your order at the Final Price (the “<strong>Execution</strong>”).

<p>Notwithstanding the above, the Company, in its sole discretion, without any obligation whatsoever, may endeavor to comply with a request from you to cancel a transaction on your Account. Subject to applicable law and regulation, in the event the Company cancels your Purchase order after having received Fiat Money from you with regards to such order, the Company will refund such funds to you minus any costs or expenses incurred with regards to such refund, including without limitation any bank charges, currency exchange charges and/or payment processing charges. With respect to cancellation of your Sale order after having received Digital Currency from you, the Company will credit you with such Digital Currency minus applicable transaction costs and expenses. Any return for a canceled transaction shall be at an exchange rate determined in the Company's sole reasonable discretion.</p>

In the event of termination of any transaction, the Company will make reasonable efforts to provide you with notification of such termination. If any fees apply on failed bank-transfer attempts made by the Company to you in the course of executing your Sale order, and such failure is reasonably attributed to an error by you, such fees shall be deducted from either (x) the amount of Fiat Money that is transferred to you if the order is subsequently executed; or (y) the amount of Digital Currency that is returned to you if the order is declined and the Digital Currency is returned.</p>

<p>4.2.10.&nbsp;<strong>Ownership of your Wallet Address</strong>.&nbsp; You guarantee to use and provide a Wallet Address owned by you exclusively and which is under your sole and full control, for the purpose of executing any transaction, including: (a) in a Purchase order, a Wallet Address to which we will transfer Digital Currency; (b) in a Sale order, a Wallet address (or&nbsp;Wallet Addresses) from which you will transfer Digital Currency to us and/or a Wallet Address to which we may return Digital Currency.</p>

<p>4.2.11. The Company reserves the right to deny processing any order, or cancel any pending transaction if:</p>

<ol style="color: #20509e !important;">
	<li>required to do so by law, regulation, competent court order, or other competent authority;</li>
	<li>the Company considers any such order or transaction to be in conflict with our Risk Management Policy, or as violating any provision of these Terms of Use, or applicable law or regulation;</li>

However, we reserve the right to decline transfers to such Wallet Address and require you to provide an alternative Wallet Address at our sole reasonable discretion. If you neglect or refuse to provide a Wallet Address that is acceptable to us, as determined in our sole reasonable discretion, we may take any additional actions available to us under these Terms of Use or other applicable laws and regulations with respect to such transaction</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>15. Know-Your-Customer ("KYC"), Anti-money Laundering (“AML”) and Counter Terrorist Financing (“CTF”) Procedures</strong></p>

These include our KYC, AML and CTF procedures, which are based on our collection of information about our Users, the assessment of AML/CTF risks associated with their activities, and the ongoing monitoring of transactions made by them.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>16. Risks</strong></p>

<p>16.1. The trading of goods and products, real or virtual, as well as virtual (digital) currencies, involves significant risks. Prices can fluctuate on any given day. Due to such price fluctuations, you may increase or lose value in your assets at any given moment. Any currency, virtual or not, may be subject to large or sudden shifts in value and may even become worthless. There is an inherent risk that losses will occur as a result of buying, selling or trading anything on a market. You should be aware that the risk of loss in trading or holding Digital Currencies can be substantial.</p>

<p>16.2. Digital Currency trading also has special risks not generally shared with official currencies or goods or commodities in a market. Unlike most currencies, which are backed by governments or other legal entities, or by commodities such as gold or silver, Digital Currency is a unique kind of currency, backed by technology and trust. There is no central bank or government regulator that can take corrective measures to protect the value of the Digital Currency in a crisis, issue more currency, or balance the price fluctuations.</p>

<p>16.3. Instead, Digital Currency is an autonomous and largely unregulated worldwide system of currency firms and individuals. Traders and market participants put their trust in a digital, decentralized and partially anonymous system that relies on peer-to-peer networking and cryptography to maintain its integrity. Thus, the value of Digital Currency may be derived from the continued willingness of market participants to exchange Fiat Currency for Digital Currency, which may result in the potential for the permanent and total loss of value of a particular Digital Currency should the market for that Digital Currency disappear.</p>

<p>16.4. Digital Currency trading may be susceptible to irrational (or rational) bubbles or loss of confidence, which could collapse relative to demand and supply. For example, confidence in Digital Currency might collapse as a result of unexpected changes imposed by software developers or others, a government crackdown, the creation of superior competing alternative currencies, or a deflationary or inflationary spiral. Confidence might also collapse because of technical problems, for example, if the anonymity of the system is compromised, if money is lost or stolen, or if hackers or governments are able to prevent transactions from settling.</p>

<p>16.5. Transactions in the Digital Currency may be irreversible, and, accordingly, losses due to fraudulent or accidental transactions may not be recoverable.</p>

<p>16.6. Due to the nature of Digital Currency, any technological difficulties experienced by the Company could prevent the access or use of a Member’s Digital Currency.</p>

<p>16.7. The abovementioned is not a closed list, there may be additional risks that we have not foreseen or identified in our Terms of Use. You should carefully assess whether your financial standing and tolerance for risk are suitable for buying, selling or trading Digital Currency.</p>
